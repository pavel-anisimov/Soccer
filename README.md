5. Intent:<br>
To have fun trying to predict soccer scores of major matches; to compete with friends in scores predictions<br>

5. Functionality: <br>
     a) Application allows a close group of friends to predict soccer scores of major games (Manchester United, Chelsea, AC Milan, Barcelona, etc.)<br>
     b) Administrator has an ability to select important matches for the prediction pool (Champions League, WC Qualifications, English Premier League, etc)<br>
     c) For guessing a games score correctly, a user gets 3 points, for guessing only the overall result - 1 point<br>
     d) Allows keeping track of the players progress by accessing a full statistic on correct and incorrect guesses<br>

6. Issues:<br>
     a) During the development of the application quality was scarified for the speed and the delivery. <br>
     b) Lack of the planning and clear guidance and requirements brought the application to the point where upgrading and extending process is not efficient anymore.<br> 
     d) Application was the first major attempt to create a fully functional PHP application and lack of the experience is noticeable.<br>
     e) As primary language, the app was written with PHP5.1 and HTML4.1 in 2010. Some of the functionality is obsolete from the coding standards.<br>
     f) Application is usable with minor glitches that do not affect the whole usability.  <br>

     b) User-friendly interface with mobile device usability<br>
     c) Improved Database with more flexible CRUD<br>
