     b) Lack of the planning and clear guidance and requirements brought the application to the point where upgrading and extending process is not efficient anymore. 
     d) Application was the first major attempt to create a fully functional PHP application and lack of the experience is noticeable.
     e) As primary language, the app was written with PHP5.1 and HTML4.1 in 2010. Some of the functionality is obsolete from the coding standards.
     f) Application is usable with minor glitches that do not affect the whole usability.
